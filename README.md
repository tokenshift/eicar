# Meicar

Provides a wrapper around the [EICAR anti-malware test file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file)
so that you don't have to check it into your repo (and freak out other devs
with a bunch of ignorable virus warnings).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'meicar'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install eicar
